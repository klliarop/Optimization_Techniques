# Assignment for Optimization Techniques Course 2023-2024

Electrical and Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTh)

## 1st Deliverable:
Development and comparison of various optimization techniques (Bisection, Fibonacci, Golden Ratio and Projected Steepest Descent Methods) for minimization problems

## 2nd Deliverable:
Implementation of a Genetic Algorithm to tackle the complex traffic flow optimization problem defined in the assignment. The GA aims to minimize the total travel time across the road network while adhering to flow conservation constraints at each intersection. Standard genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation are employed.
